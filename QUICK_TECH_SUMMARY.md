## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

### **Core**
- **Flutter** - Cross-platform mobile framework (iOS + Android from one codebase)
- **Dart** - Programming language
- **Material Design 3** - Modern UI components

### **Architecture**
- **Clean Architecture** - Separates business logic, data, and UI
- **BLoC Pattern** - State management (like Redux/MobX)
- **Dependency Injection** - GetIt service locator

### **Key Packages**
- `flutter_bloc` - State management
- `go_router` - Navigation
- `get_it` - Dependency injection
- `dartz` - Functional programming (error handling)
- `shared_preferences` - Local storage

## 🏗️ **Architecture in Simple Terms**

```
UI Layer (What users see)
    ↓
Business Logic Layer (Rules and operations)
    ↓
Data Layer (Storage and API calls)
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to test
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to add features
- Professional code structure
